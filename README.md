## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this news website homepage and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

For this challenge I have used HTML5, CSS and JavaScript/JQuery skills.

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size;
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.
